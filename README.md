1.
I stuck with freecodecamp's website layout because
It is the best way to capture all details in a single glance 
Other learning platform requires you to click on a button
To see your code then back to output. This is not good for
The user experience so I stuck with the layout for its 
Simplicity

2.
I added a couple of call to action to it like the TAKE NOTES 
Most times as a reader you gain a valuable point and you 
Want to jot it down I decided to create an in house note
Which saves your jottings all you need to do is just click on 
The saved notes and you'd access it. I had to understand the 
User my emphatizing with them putting myself in their shoes. 

3. 
I added the change colour mode this is mainly to help the 
Colour blinded users have a seemless experience.

4.
I decided to create a side menu bar for easy navigation around
The website

5. 
I created a summary version of every lesson for pple to
Get a fast and clear overview of the course

6. 
I stuck with AH colour campaign.

7. There are a couple of ux laws I employed such as
Gelstats law, Fitts law amongst other basic principle sticking to simplicity.
